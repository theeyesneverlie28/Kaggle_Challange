# Mushroom-Classification

Mushroom is an important fungus which contains a good source of vitamin B and a large amount of protein when compared to all other vegetables. It helps to prevent cancer, useful in weight loss and increases the immunity power of human. On the other hand, some mushrooms are toxic and can prove dangerous if we eat them. 

In this project, we will use the data ( which is available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification ) to prediect where a mushroom contains toxicity or not. The remakable obtained result is that the accuracy of this model is really high (almost 100% for Logistic Regression and 100% for Neural Network at SVM). But there is no variable that is highly correlated with the response variable. All of the predictors are magically combined with each other to create a highly-confident preditor for the response variable.
